## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Notion App
   I love the level of personalization and the liberty that users have to style pages as they see fit. For example, whenever the user writes '/' they have numerous options to personalize their page.

  I like the design and icons in the app, it looks intuitive and elegant

2. Slack:
3. I enjoy how easy it is to use and create your own emojis

     The threads feature is really useful to reply without sending notifications to everyone:

   The channels feature and sidebar is really easy to navigate. I am part of various Slack channels so having the ability to easily switch is very helpful.

5. WhatsApp:
   I use WhatsApp because it allows me to communicate with family and friends via Internet instead of a paid messages service.
   I like the UI and UX design of the app, it is easy to navigate and well-organized
## App Idea: (Making your own fyp)
Although I don't have the technical knowledge yet, I want to create an app that allows any user to control and regulate content and time spent on social media. 
  The app can help a user specify the type of content they want to watch and for how long as soon as they open any social media app. Then, my app could interact with APIs from the given social media app and provide helpful data and analytics for a user. For example, I want to watch educational reels on Instagram and track how many reels I found useful. The goal is to allow users to train their short-term memory and feel more in control and aware of the type of content they consume.
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:
Finding where tools such as the Source Control or Simulators were in XCode was a bit challenging since it was my first time using the App. 
Later, when I wanted to add my own features I spent most of the time watching videos and searching online on sites such as StackOverflow to know how things are names in Swift.
